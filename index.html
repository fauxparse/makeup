              My grandad couldn't abide poorly polished shoes, so my mum would
              leave her shoes near him, and he'd be incapable of resisting
              polishing them.

          <h1>Myths about CSS</h1>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Myth #1</h6>
          <h2>CSS is weird/confusing/magic</h2>

          <p class="fragment">At its heart, CSS is very simple:</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>rules</strong> apply <strong>properties</strong> to <strong>elements</strong></p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>more specific</strong> styles override<br><strong>less specific</strong> ones</p>
          <p class="fragment">It‚Äôs getting more powerful and better supported, but not more <strong>complex</strong>.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is a SMART PERSON, who admits that CSS is hard.</p>
            <p>
              Just because something is hard doesn‚Äôt mean it's not worth
              trying to understand.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Myth #2</h6>
          <h2>CSS isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù code</h2>
          <p class="fragment">You write it in a text editor</p>
          <p class="fragment">It affects the behaviour of your software</p>
          <p class="fragment"><strong>Surprise!</strong> HTML + CSS is Turing complete</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>By ‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù I mean the interaction between users and software, which goes both ways.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Myth #3</h6>
          <h2>CSS encourages bad coding habits</h2>

          <p class="fragment">Any tool can be abused</p>
          <p class="fragment">I used PHP for ten years<br>and I turned out okay<br><span class="fragment">(so did Facebook)</span></p>
          <p class="fragment">Bad coding habits don't come from bad tools, they come from <strong>bad attitudes</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h6>Myth #4</h6>
          <h2>CSS is just cosmetic</h2>
          <p class="fragment">Nobody said this about the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tags we were all hard-coding in the early 2000s</p>
          <p class="fragment">More and more, CSS implements behaviour</p>
          <p class="fragment">Cosmetics directly add business value</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>My old boss (not pictured) went so far as to call the visual design part of a project the ‚Äúlipstick layer‚Äù</p>

            <p>
              So I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about CSS. But the more I
